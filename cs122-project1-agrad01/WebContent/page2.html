			Understanding the needs of your business can help naroow your web
			hosting options. If you plan to build a <span style="color: red">website
			</span>that features video blogging, 24-hour live streaming and the
			ability for visitors to register and upload their own videos, your <span
				style="color: red">website </span>would require more features than
			someone who just uses their <span style="color: red">website
			</span> as a virtual resume. <span style="color: red">Website </span> that
			recieve a lot of daily traffic will likely not function well on a
			shared serve because these servers are designed to accommodate
			a lot of small <span style="color: red">website </span>that have
			limited demands.
